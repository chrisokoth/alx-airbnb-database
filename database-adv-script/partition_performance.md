Improvements Observed:
Reduced Query Time: Partitioning allowed the database to only scan the relevant partitions for queries filtering by date. This significantly reduced the number of rows processed, leading to faster query execution times.
Efficient Storage: The partitioned table is more optimized for managing large datasets over time. For example, querying for bookings in the past year is now much faster than scanning the entire table.
Partition Pruning: The database uses partition pruning, which means that only the relevant partitions are queried, further improving performance by eliminating unnecessary data scans.
Scalability: As the number of records grows, partitioning ensures that queries remain efficient and scalable. New partitions can be added as needed without major modifications to the existing table structure.
